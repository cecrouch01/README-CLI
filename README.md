  ## Installation

  To install this CLI you must download all of the folders and upload it into the project you want. Also, create a GITHUB_TOKEN to be used in the .env file and add the .env to the .gitignore file. 

  ## Usage
  This can be used for any README used in any coding project. As stated before this read me was created using the CLI! If you want to see a video of this CLI being using click on this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v01IIW6RAecDb3H-Lfc0-0VcyyhrF3Wd/view

  ## Contributing Credits
  For this application I used inquirer and badge-maker. These allowed for me to create prompts for the user to interact with and create a badge for the license being used. Thanks Aaron Brown for showing me how to use octokit and svg files!
